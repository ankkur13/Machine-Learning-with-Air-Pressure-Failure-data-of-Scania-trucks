> # Case: Machine Learning with Air Pressure Failure data of Scania trucks

## Summary: 
AdaptiveAlgo Systems Inc. has invited us to help them in implementing data science solutions.
Our team is aiming to deleiver high performance solutions in a timely manner. AdaptiveAlgo 
has provided a dataset related to Air pressure system failure and operational data 
in Scania trucks.Our goal is to develop prediction models and to select accuarte model with 
minimum Total cost.


## Introduction:
>This part of case study consists of various elements of Machine learning.
>Following are the contents of this part of case study.


| Part | Description |
| :------| :-----------|
| Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis | Conduct EDA using Python libraries (plotly, seaborn, matplotlib etc.)|
| Part 2: Feature Engineering | Conduct thorough feature analysis and use pre-processing techniques to make the data usable. |
| Part 3: Prediction Algorithms | Try Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and XGBoost to build prediction models in using sklearn in Python. Compute AUC_ROC_Score for Training and Testing Datasets. Recommend a model.|
| Part 4: Serialization | Serialize Machine Learning Algorithms using Pickle, followed by saving the serialized format into a file. |
| Part 5: Final Pipeline | Luigi framework is used to build pipeline to connect data processing elements. |
| Part 6: Report | Put together a comprehensive report discussing analysis in pdf. |
